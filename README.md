## Monaco Next.js cloud IDE demo

This is a simple [Next.js app](https://nextjs.org) with a cloud IDE created with
[Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) and
[Deno Deploy Subhosting API](https://deno.com/subhosting). It allows users to
deploy and execute code from the browser.

[Check out the full tutorial here](https://deno.com/blog/monaco-nextjs).

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/ide](http://localhost:3000/ide) with your browser to
open the IDE. Enter any JavaScript code and press Run.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/ide/page.js`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.
